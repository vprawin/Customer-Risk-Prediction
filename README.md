# Customer-Risk-Prediction (Banking)
## Perform Risk Prediction of Bank Customer using Python

- The dataset consists of 20 features of the customers.
- These 20 features are used to predict if the customer could be given a credit
- Many features required data cleaning.

**Class Label's**

- 0 => Blue => Good
- 1 => Orange => Bad



3 Models were used to predict the Credit Capabilities of Customer
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
